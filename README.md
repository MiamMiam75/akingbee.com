A website for beekeepers !

This website aims to help beekeepers to manage their hives and record everything which has happened (or will happen).

It's mostly a pet project that I started a few years ago and on which I kept working on through the years, and still continue.

Today the project is composed of several services.

## Aristaeus

The service which is in charge of managing hives & apiaries.
Aristaeus is the Greek god that discovered bee-keeping.

## Cerbes

Manage users & authentication.
Who's better than cerberus himself to protect the realm of bees ?

## Gaea

Python library used in other python services.

## Poseidon

Frontend app in react.
