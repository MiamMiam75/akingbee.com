A website for beekeepers !

This website aims to help beekeepers to manage their hives and record everything which has happened (or will happen).

It's mostly a pet project that I started a few years ago and on which I kept working on through the years, and still continue.

Today the project is composed of several services.

## Aristaeus

Aristaeus is the Greek god that discovered bee-keeping. 
It only makes sense that the service is in charge of managing hives & apiaries is named after this god.

The service itself is composed of a web api and of a rabbitmq listener.


## Cerbes

Who's better than cerberus himself to protect the realm of bees ?

Cerbes will manages users & authentication through jwt. It's not keeping the gates of hell, but it does guard the entrance of something.
It's reason enough for me to name it this way.

## Hermes

Hermes if the messager of the gods ! I couldn't name a service that sends emails otherwise.

## Gaea

Gaea is the mother of all gods.

It's also the python library used in other python services. Because everyone needs a mother to rely on, even gods.

## Poseidon

Poseidon, gods of the seas and oceans. Not better gods than him for spreading my website through the vast of internet.

It's basically a react app. Fair warning: check out this service at your own risk.
